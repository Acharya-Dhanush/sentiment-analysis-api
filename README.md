# Sentiment Analysis API ðŸš€  

This project is a Flask-based Sentiment Analysis API that predicts whether a given text expresses positive or negative sentiment. It uses TF-IDF vectorization and a machine learning model, specifically Logistic Regression, trained on labeled text data.

### Project Structure  
The project consists of various folders and files, including:  
- A `data` folder for datasets (archive.zip)  
- A `models` (sentiment_model.pkl, tfidf_vectorizer.pkl)folder containing the trained model and vectorizer  
- A `google collab` folder with google collab for model training  
- The `app.py` script for running the Flask API    
- A `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies  
- A `README.md` file containing documentation  
- The trained model and vectorizer files (`sentiment_model.pkl` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl`)  
- A database file (`imdb_reviews.db`) if using SQLite  

### Installation & Setup  
To set up the project, first, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project folder. Then, create a virtual environment and activate it. After that, install all required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.  

If a database is being used, run the setup script to prepare it. For MySQL or PostgreSQL, use the provided SQL file to create tables.  

### Running the Sentiment Analysis API  
To start the Flask API, run the `app.py` script. If successful, the API will be accessible locally at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.  

### Testing the API  
The API can be tested in multiple ways:  
1. Using command-line tools like `curl` to send requests.  
2. Using a Python script with the `requests` library to send and receive predictions.  
3. Using Postman by setting the request type to POST, entering the API URL, and providing a JSON input in the request body.  

### Model Information  
The sentiment analysis model is based on Logistic Regression and uses TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction. It was trained on the IMDB movie reviews dataset and achieves approximately 85% accuracy on test data. The trained model and vectorizer are stored as separate files.  

### Troubleshooting  
If the Flask app does not start, check whether port 5000 is already in use and terminate any conflicting processes. If the model file is missing, ensure that the trained model and vectorizer files are available in the project directory.  

### Contributing  
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork the repository, improve the model, or add new features.
